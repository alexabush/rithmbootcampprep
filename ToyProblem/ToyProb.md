# Problem 1:
- Create function SumAll.  Sum all numbers in a range.  
- More detail P1: Create a program that will take an array of two numbers who are not necessarily in order, and then add not just those numbers but any numbers in between.  For ex), [3,1] will be the same as 1+2+3 and not just 3+1.
