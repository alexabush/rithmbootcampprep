# Problem 1:
- Create function SumAll.  Sum all numbers in a range.  
- More detail P1: Create a program that will take an array of two numbers who are not necessarily in order, and then add not just those numbers but any numbers in between.  For ex), [3,1] will be the same as 1+2+3 and not just 3+1.

Hint: 1 
- Use Math.max() to find the maximum value of two numbers.

Hint: 2
- Use Math.min() to find the minimum value of two numbers.

Hint: 3
- Remember to that you must add all the numbers in between so this would require a way to get those numbers.

# Problem 2:
- Find buy/sell prices in array of stock values to maximize positive difference
